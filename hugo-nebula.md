I seem to be off by a year, at least when I look at the Nebula Awards own pages. These notes
came from Wikipedia, which is giving a higher year for each one. I think that the Wikipedia
page is giving the year in which each one is awarded, whereas the Nebulas themselves seem to
take an extra year to award? And actually, I'm confused, because their web page says "2020
awards just given" but links to a page which says 2019. Maybe it's because these are voted
in the 2020 Nebula Conference for the 2019 year? So confusing. I should probably change
the years, because the "simultaneous Hugo/Nebula" winners don't line up otherwise.

Addendum - not off by a year, the rules by which the awards were given changed over time,
and the Nebula year is now consistently the year of publication, whereas the Hugo year is the
year of the award (at a convention). So it will be that the Nebula for 2019 could be the Hugo
of 2020.

## Reference

Hugo awards are nominated and voted on by fans - the attendees of the annual World Science Fiction
Convention). Nebula awards are voted by professionals - the members of the Science Fiction and
Fantasy Writers of America. As such, both systems have their strengths and weaknesses, so it's
hard to pick one over the other. It's not about popularity, because writers are just as prone
to that as readers.

Hugos started being awarded in 1953, although there are "retro awards" going back to 1939. Nebulas
started being awarded in 1965.

Nebulas started being awarded in 1966
